                                    <p> The Ministry of MSME, Government of India and SIDBI set up the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) with a view to facilitate flow of credit to the MSE sector without the need for collaterals / third party guarantees. </p>
                                    <p>The main objective of the scheme is that the lender should give importance to project viability and secure the credit facility purely on the primary security of the assets financed. The Credit Guarantee scheme (CGS) seeks to reassure the lender that, in the event of a MSE unit, which availed collateral - free credit facilities, failing to discharge its liabilities to the lender, the Guarantee Trust would make good the loss incurred by the lender up to 85 per cent of the outstanding amount in default. </p>
                                    <p> The CGTMSE would provide cover for credit facility up to Rs. 200 lakh which have been extended by lending institutions without any collateral security and /or third-party guarantees. A guarantee and annual service fee is charged by the CGTMSE to avail of the guarantee cover. </p>
    
                    <p><strong>Revised Scheme:</strong> Financial assistance on already existing schemes Upto 20% of entire Outstanding credit as on 29.2.2020 for Units upto Rs. 100 cr. turnover eligible. No guarantee fee, no fresh collateral.</p>

                    <p>Guarantee will commence from guarantee start date and shall run through the agreed tenure of the term loan / composite loans. Where working capital facilities alone are extended to eligible borrowers, it would be for a period of 5 years or block of 5 years on renewal of the guarantee cover, provided MLI pays the Annual Service Fee due as on March 31, latest by within 60 days from the date of demand by CGTMSE.</p>

                                <p>The tenure for coverage of working capital facilities is 5 years, where working capital alone is covered under the scheme. In case term credit and working capital both are covered under the scheme, the tenure relating to working capital facility would match the normal repayment period of term credit. </p>
                                <p>The reason for keeping a limit of 5 years wherever working capital alone are covered are that the period for which the same are extended by the lending institutions are not time bound. </p>
                                <p>The same are reviewed periodically for increase/ decrease in the limit sanctioned, and are expected to continue for a time frame much longer than 5 years. CGTMSE welcomes any renewal of guarantee cover beyond 5 years on a payment of applicable guarantee fee.</p>

                <p> The Ministry implements the "Technology and Quality Upgradation Support to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (TEQUP)" which focuses on two important aspects, namely, enhancing competitiveness of MSME sector through Energy Efficiency and Product Quality Certification. The basic objective of this scheme is to encourage MSMEs in adopting energy efficient technologies and to improve product quality of manufacturing in MSMEs. It is a well-known fact that energy consumption is a significant component in the cost structure of almost any manufacturing/ production activity. Adopting energy efficient technologies curtails the cost of energy there by reducing production cost and increasing competitiveness. Under this scheme, a capital subsidy of 25% of the project cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 10.00 lakh shall be provided to the registered MSME units. While 25% of the project cost will be provided as subsidy by the Government of India, the balance amount is to be funded through loan from SIDBI/banks/financial institutions. The minimum contribution as required by the funding agency will have to be made by the MSME unit.

                <p> The TEQUP scheme envisages another activity, namely, Product Quality Certification. The main objective of this scheme is to encourage MSMEs to Acquire Product Certification Licenses from National / International Bodies, thereby improving their competitiveness. The primary objective of this activity is to provide subsidy to MSME units towards the expenditure incurred by them for obtaining product certification licenses from National / International standardization Bodies. Under this Activity, MSME manufacturing units will be provided subsidy to the extent of 75% of the actual expenditure, towards licensing of product to National/International Standards. The maximum GOI assistance allowed per MSME is Rs.1.5 lakh for obtaining product licensing /Marking to National Standards and Rs. 2.0 lakh for obtaining product licensing /Marking to International standards. One MSME unit can apply only once under the scheme period.

                        <p>In order to ensure that sufficient credit is available to micro enterprises  within the MSE sector, banks should ensure that:</p>
                        <p>40 per cent of the total advances to MSE sector should go to micro  (manufacturing) enterprises having investment in plant and machinery up to Rs.  10 lakh and micro (service) enterprises having investment in equipment up to  Rs. 4 lakh ; 20 per cent of the total advances to MSE sector should go to micro  (manufacturing) enterprises with investment in plant and machinery above Rs. 10  lakh and up to Rs. 25 lakh, and micro (service) enterprises with investment in  equipment above Rs. 4 lakh and up to Rs. 10 lakh. Thus, 60 per cent of MSE  advances should go to the micro enterprises.</p>

                        <p>The banks have been advised by  RBI to put in place loan policies governing extension of credit facilities for  the MSE sector duly approved by their Board of Directors Vide RBI circular;  RPCD.SME &amp; FS.BC.No.102/06.04.01/2008-09 dated May 4, 2009 ).</p>
                        <p>Banks have, however, been advised to sanction limits after proper appraisal  of the genuine working capital requirements of the borrowers keeping in mind  their business cycle and short term credit requirement. As per Nayak Committee  Report, working capital limits to SSI units is computed on the basis of minimum  20% of their estimated turnover up to credit limit of Rs. 5 crore. For more  details paragraph 4.12.2 of the RBI Master Circular on lending to the MSME  sector dated July 1, 2010 may please be seen.</p>

                        <p><strong>26. Is there any provision for grant of composite loans by banks?</strong></p>
                        <p>A composite loan limit of Rs.1  crore can be sanctioned by banks to enable the MSME entrepreneurs to avail of  their working capital and term loan requirement through Single Window in terms  of RBI Master Circular on lending to the MSME sector dated July 1, 2010. All  scheduled commercial banks have been advised by our circular RPCD.SME&amp;NFS.  BC.No.102/06.04.01/2008-09 on May 4, 2009 that the banks which have sanctioned  term loan singly or jointly must also sanction working capital (WC) limit  singly (or jointly, in the ratio of term loan) to avoid delay in commencement  of commercial production thereby ensuring that there are no cases where term  loan has been sanctioned and working capital facilities are yet to be  sanctioned. These instructions have been reiterated to schedule commercial  banks on March 11, 2010.</p>

                        <p><strong>27. What is Cluster financing?</strong></p>
                        <p>Cluster based approach to  lending is intended to provide a full-service approach to cater to the diverse  needs of the MSE sector which may be achieved through extending banking  services to recognized MSE clusters. A cluster based approach may be more  beneficial </p>
                        <p>(a) In dealing with well-defined and recognized groups <br>
                            (b) Availability of appropriate information for risk assessment <br>

                        </p>
                        <p>The banks have, therefore, been advised to treat it as a thrust area and  increasingly adopt the same for SME financing. United Nations Industrial  Development Organisation (UNIDO) has identified 388 clusters spread over 21  states in various parts of the country. The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium  Enterprises has also approved a list of clusters under the Scheme of Fund for  Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) and Micro and Small Enterprises  Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) located in 121 Minority Concentration  Districts. Accordingly, banks have been advised to take appropriate measures to  improve the credit flow to the identified clusters.</p>
                        <p>Banks have also been advised that they should open more MSE focused branch  offices at different MSE clusters which can also act as counseling.</p>
                        <p>Centres for MSEs. Each lead bank of the district may adopt at least one  cluster (Refer circular RPCD.SME &amp; NFS.No.BC.90/06.02.31/2009-10 dated June  29, 2010 )</p>

                        <p>As part of the financial  sector liberalization, all credit related matters of banks including charging  of interest have been deregulated by RBI and are governed by the banks' own  lending policies.</p>

                        <p>A viable/potentially viable  unit may apply for a debt restructuring if it shows early stage of stickiness.  In such cases the banks may consider to reschedule the debt for repayment,  consider additional funds etc. A debt restructuring mechanism for units in MSME  sector has been formulated and advised to all commercial banks. The detailed  guidelines have been issued to ensure restructuring of debt of all eligible  small and medium enterprises. Prudential guidelines on restructuring of  advances have also been issued which harmony the prudential norms over all  categories of debt restructuring mechanisms (other than those restructured on  account of natural calamities). </p>

                        <p>As per the extant guidelines,  a Micro or Small Enterprise (as defined in the MSMED Act 2006) may be said to  have become Sick, if</p>
                        <p>Any of the borrower account of the enterprise remains NPA for three months  or more.</p>
                        <p>OR</p>
                        <p>There is erosion in the net worth due to accumulated losses to the extent  of 50% of its net worth during the previous accounting year. This criterion  enables banks to detect sickness at an early stage and facilitate corrective  action for revival of the unit.</p>

                        <p><strong>32. Are all sick units put under rehabilitation by banks?</strong></p>
                        <p>No. If a sick unit is found  potentially viable it can be rehabilitated by the banks. The viability of the  unit is decided by banks. A unit should be declared unviable only if such a  status is evidenced by a viability study.</p>

                        <p><strong>33. Is there a time frame within which the banks are required to implement  the rehabilitation package?</strong></p>
                        <p>Viable / potentially viable  MSE units/enterprises, which turn sick in spite of debt re-structuring, would  need to be rehabilitated and put under nursing. It will be for the  banks/financial institutions to decide whether a sick MSE unit is potentially  viable or not. The rehabilitation package should be fully implemented by banks  within six months from the date the unit is declared as potentially  viable/viable. During this six months period of identifying and implementing  rehabilitation package banks/FIs are required to do &ldquo;holding operation&rdquo; which  will allow the sick unit to draw funds from the cash credit account at least to  the extent of deposit of sale proceeds. The relevant circular on rehabilitation  of sick units is RPCD.CO.MSME &amp; NFS.BC.40/06.02.31/2012-2013 dated November  1, 2012 is available on our website.</p>

                        <p><strong>34. What is the procedure and time frame for conducting the viability  study?</strong></p>
                        <p>The decision on viability of  the unit should be taken at the earliest but not later than 3 months of the  unit becoming sick under any circumstances. The following procedure should be  adopted by the banks before declaring any unit as unviable:</p>
                        <p>A unit should be declared unviable only if the viability status is  evidenced by a viability study. However, it may not be feasible to conduct  viability study in very small units and will only increase paperwork. As such  for micro (manufacturing) enterprises, having investment in plant and machinery  up to Rs. 5 lakh and micro (service) enterprises having investment in equipment  up to Rs. 2 lakh, the Branch Manager may take a decision on viability and  record the same, along with the justification.</p>
                        <p> The declaration of the unit as  unviable, as evidenced by the viability study, should have the approval of the  next higher authority/ present sanctioning authority for both micro and small  units. In case such a unit is declared unviable, an opportunity should be given  to the unit to present the case before the next higher authority. The  modalities for presenting the case to the next higher authority may be worked  out by the banks in terms of their Board approved policies in this regard the  next higher authority should take such decision only after giving an  opportunity to the promoters of the unit to present their case. For sick units  declared unviable, with credit facilities of Rs. 1 crore and above, a Committee  approach may be adopted.</p>
                        <p> A Committee comprising of senior officials of the bank  may examine such proposals. This is expected to improve the quality of  decisions as collective wisdom of the members shall be utilized, especially  while taking decision on rehabilitation proposals. The final decision should be  communicated to the promoters in writing. The above process should be completed  in a time bound manner and should not take more than 3 months.</p>

                        <p>At the initiative of the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), Rural Self  Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) have been set up by various banks all  over the country. These RSETIs are managed by banks with active co-operation  from the Government of India and State Governments. RSETIs conduct various  short duration (ranging preferably from 1 to 6 weeks) skill upgradation  programmes to help the existing entrepreneurs compete in this ever-changing  global market. RSETIs ensure that a list of candidates trained by them is sent  to all bank branches of the area and co-ordinate with them for grant of financial  assistance under any Govt. sponsored scheme or direct lending.</p>

                        <p>Banks have been advised to either separately set up special cells at their  branches, or vertically integrate this function in the Financial Literacy  Centres (FLCs) set up by them, as per their comparative advantage. Through  these FLCs, banks provide assistance to the MSE entrepreneurs in regard to  financial literacy, operational skills, including accounting and finance,  business planning etc. (Refer circular RPCD.MSME &amp;  NFS.BC.No.20/06.02.31/2012-13 dated August 1, 2012)</p>

                            <p> The objective of TReDS is to create Electronic Bill Factoring Exchanges which could electronically accept and settle bills so that MSMEs could encash their receivables without delay. This will not only give them greater access to finance but will also put greater discipline on corporates to pay their dues on time. For more details you may refer to RBI guidelines for setting up and operating TReDS on their website https://www.m1xchange.com/treds.php </p>

                            <p><strong>6.	How does TReDS work?</strong></p>
                            <p> Broadly, following steps take place during financing / discounting through TReDS: 
                                Creation of a Factoring Unit (FU) - standard nomenclature used in TReDS for invoice(s) or bill(s) of exchange - containing details of invoices / bills of exchange (evidencing sale of goods / services by the MSME sellers to the buyers) on TReDS platform by the MSME seller (in case of factoring) or the buyer (in case of reverse factoring); 
                                Acceptance of the FU by the counterparty - buyer or the seller, as the case may be; 
                                Bidding by financiers; 
                                Selection of best bid by the seller or the buyer, as the case may be; 
                                Payment made by the financier (of the selected bid) to the MSME seller at the agreed rate of financing / discounting; 
                                Payment by the buyer to the financier on the due date.

                            <p><strong>7.	What is a Factoring Unit (FU)?</strong></p>
                            <p> A Factoring Unit (FU) is a standard nomenclature used in TReDS for invoice(s) or bill(s) of exchange. Each FU represents a confirmed obligation of the corporates or other buyers, including Government Departments and PSUs. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                            <p><strong>8.	 Who can create a FU? </strong></p>
                            <p> In TReDS, FU can be created either by the MSME seller or the buyer. If MSME seller creates it, the process is called factoring; if the same is created by corporates or other buyers, it is called as reverse factoring. </p>
                        </div>

                            <p><strong>9.	Whether TReDS could deal with reverse factoring?</strong></p>
                            <p> Yes. The TReDS could deal with both receivables factoring as well as reverse factoring. </p>
                        </div>
