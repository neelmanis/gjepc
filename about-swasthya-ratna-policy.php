                <p>The GJEPC launched Swasthya Ratna, a group mediclaim scheme, to provide health insurance benefit to the entire workforce of the gems and jewellery industry and their family members in 2015. </p>
                <p>The primary objective of launching this scheme is to provide quality medical care of choice to the workforce of the industry.
                </p>
                <p>GJEPC has partnered with Edelweiss Gallagher Insurance Brokers Ltd. to run and manage the scheme. The Council has meticulously worked with Edelweiss Gallagher to create a flexible scheme with different options like family size, coverages, benefits, etc., which enables companies of different sizes to avail of tailor-made plans. </p>
                <p>Council has negotiated affordable premiums and contributes a percentage of the premium amount through its CSR initiative as an additional benefit for its members. The scheme is accessible from all parts of India through GJEPC offices in Mumbai, Surat, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. </p>
                <p>The Swasthya Ratna Scheme has received a phenomenal response over the last 5 years of its operation and several gem and jewellery companies have obtained the policy for their employees</p>
