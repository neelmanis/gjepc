                <p>The ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises had in September 2015 notified Udyog Aadhaar, taking a cue from the Prime Minister's radio show "Mann ki Baat", wherein he had talked about simplifying procedures to start a business with a single-page registration form.  </p>
                
                <p>In the beginning, a large chunk of enterprises in India were simply not registered due to the cumbersome paper work involved in the process and, therefore, can't tap the government schemes for them. The concept of Udyog aadhaar and ease of registration have thus originated to ensure wider coverage of MSMEs to avail the benefits under various schemes of Central/State governments.</p>
