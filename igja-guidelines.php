               <p>The GJEPC established the India Gem & Jewellery Awards (IGJA) 48 years ago to honour leading exporters of gems and jewellery. The selection criteria now include export performance, value addition, employment generation and investment in R&D among other parameters, during each financial year.</p>
                 
                <p>In recognition of the business excellence demonstrated by companies that are helping to strengthen 'Brand India', the GJEPC not only felicitates industry players for their exemplary performance, but also recognises entities such as banks and agencies supplying gold that play a key role in the growth of the sector.</p>
                
                <p>Ernst & Young LLP, one of the world's leading multinational professional services providers, is the Knowledge Partner for IGJA.</p>
