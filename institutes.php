                <p> Skill Development and Training, and Research and Gemmological services have been on the GJEPC’s agenda almost since its inception. Today there are seven educational institutes in five cities; and four gemmological laboratories under the GJEPC umbrella. With the avowed aim of building a pool of trained manpower resources for the industry, the Council set up educational institutes offering courses in gems and jewellery manufacturing and designing in major centres for the industry in the country.
 All not-for-profit organisations, they all have state-of-the-art equipment and up-to-date facilities.</p>
