                		<p><strong>Obtaining Export Credit: </strong> <br>
The bank & other financial institutions extend financial facility for completion of export orders received from the foreign buyer. The finance is generally given for procurement of raw material or merchandise including towards cost of processing, manufacturing & packaging. The bank normally finance up to 75% of the value of export order.
</p>					
<p><strong>Pre Shipment / Packing Credit:</strong> <br>
'Pre-shipment /Packing Credit' means any loan or advance granted or any other credit provided by a bank to an exporter for financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing or packing of goods prior to shipment / working capital expenses towards rendering of services on the basis of letter of credit opened in his favour or in favour of some other person, by an overseas buyer or a confirmed and irrevocable order for the export of goods / services from India or any other evidence of an order for export from India having been placed on the exporter or some other person, unless lodgement of export orders or letter of credit with the bank has been waived.
</p>				

					<p><strong>PSCFC:</strong> <br />
'Post-shipment Credit' means any loan or advance granted or any other credit provided by a bank to an exporter of goods / services from India from the date of extending credit after shipment of goods / rendering of services to the date of realisation of export proceeds. ,and includes any loan or advance granted to an exporter, in consideration of, or on the security of any duty drawback allowed by the Government from time to time. If the loan is given in foreign currency it is termed as PSCFC.
</p>
					
                    <p> <strong>Interest Subvention: </strong> <br />
It is financial support given by Govt. for promoting the exports. Interest subvention is hence the subsidy offered on interest rates. For instances, interest subvention is offered on several lending schemes by the government to promote a particular industry for defined tariff lines. This implies that with the subsidy in hand, the loan borrower has not to pay total interest on loan amount and the balance interest amount is borne by the government. Thus, interest subvention is a form of waiver of some percentage of interest that promotes some particular industry and general public interest. For manufacturing the subvention rate is 5% & for services it is 3%. </p>
