        <p> It is a well-known fact that charity runs in the genes of all the noble people involved in the trade and each business house in this Diamond industry spends a given percentage of their earnings on charity as a routine.  The charitable activities include running of schools, hospitals, medical camps including eye operation camps for the weaker sections of the society.  Other charitable activities are running of orphanages, old age homes, Panjrapoles for old and disabled animals.  However, it was during the year 1999, in the aftermath of Kargil War that some trade illuminiaries (names with held at their request) got together and floated a trust by the name "Gem & Jewellery National Relief Foundation" which was registered in Mumbai under Mumbai Trust Act, 1950 on 1st August, 1999.</p>
