Thus, 60 per cent of MSE advances should go to the micro enterprises.</p>

It will be for the banks/financial institutions to decide whether a sick MSE unit is potentially viable or not. The rehabilitation package should be fully implemented by banks within six months from the date the unit is declared as potentially viable/viable. During this six months period of identifying and implementing rehabilitation package banks/FIs are required to do “holding operation” which will allow the sick unit to draw funds from the cash credit account at least to the extent of deposit of sale proceeds.

            <p>The decision on viability of the unit should be taken at the earliest but not later than 3 months of the unit becoming sick under any circumstances. The following procedure should be adopted by the banks before declaring any unit as unviable:</p>
            <p>A unit should be declared unviable only if the viability status is evidenced by a viability study. However, it may not be feasible to conduct viability study in very small units and will only increase paperwork. As such for micro (manufacturing) enterprises, having investment in plant and machinery up to Rs. 5 lakh and micro (service) enterprises having investment in equipment up to Rs. 2 lakh, the Branch Manager may take a decision on viability and record the same, along with the justification. The declaration of the unit as unviable, as evidenced by the viability study, should have the approval of the next higher authority/ present sanctioning authority for both micro and small units. In case such a unit is declared unviable, an opportunity should be given to the unit to present the case before the next higher authority. The modalities for presenting the case to the next higher authority may be worked out by the banks in terms of their Board approved policies in this regard the next higher authority should take such decision only after giving an opportunity to the promoters of the unit to present their case. For sick units declared unviable, with credit facilities of Rs. 1 crore and above, a Committee approach may be adopted. A Committee comprising of senior officials of the bank may examine such proposals. This is expected to improve the quality of decisions as collective wisdom of the members shall be utilized, especially while taking decision on rehabilitation proposals. The final decision should be communicated to the promoters in writing. The above process should be completed in a time bound manner and should not take more than 3 months.</p>

            <p>The Ministry implements the “Technology and Quality Upgradation Support to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (TEQUP)” which focuses on two important aspects, namely, enhancing competitiveness of MSME sector through Energy Efficiency and Product Quality Certification. The basic objective of this scheme is to encourage MSMEs in adopting energy efficient technologies and to improve product quality of manufacturing in MSMEs. It is a well-known fact that energy consumption is a significant component in the cost structure of almost any manufacturing/ production activity. Adopting energy efficient technologies curtails the cost of energy there by reducing production cost and increasing competitiveness. Under this scheme, a capital subsidy of 25% of the project cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 10.00 lakh shall be provided to the registered MSME units. While 25% of the project cost will be provided as subsidy by the Government of India, the balance amount is to be funded through loan from SIDBI/banks/financial institutions. The minimum contribution as required by the funding agency will have to be made by the MSME unit. For further details please visit www.dcmsme.gov.in.</p>

The primary objective of this activity is to provide subsidy to MSME units towards the expenditure incurred by them for obtaining product certification licenses from National / International standardization Bodies. Under this Activity, MSME manufacturing units will be provided subsidy to the extent of 75% of the actual expenditure, towards licensing of product to National/International Standards. The maximum GOI assistance allowed per MSME is Rs.1.5 lakh for obtaining product licensing /Marking to National Standards and Rs. 2.0 lakh for obtaining product licensing /Marking to International standards. One MSME unit can apply only once under the scheme period. For further details please visit www.dcmsme.gov.in.</p>

It is launched to benefit MSMEs by creating a dynamic platform to provide expert solutions to real time Design problems and add value to existing products. The goal of this scheme is to help MSME manufacturing industries move up the value chain by switching the production mode from original equipment manufacturing to original design manufacturing and hence original brand manufacturing. In the Design Clinic scheme, the value additions to an idea or a concept are imparted through interaction at a lesser cost to a specific industry/sector. The expected outcome of such interventions is new product development by design improvement and value addition for existing products.

            <p>The Ministry is implementing the Performance & Credit Rating Scheme, the main objective of the scheme is to provide a trusted third party opinion on the capabilities and creditworthiness of the MSEs so as to create awareness amongst them about the strengths and weakness of their existing operations. This is to provide them an opportunity to improve and enhance their organizational strengths and credit worthiness, so that they can access credit at cheaper rates and on easy terms. NSIC was appointed as nodal agency to implement the scheme on behalf of the Government. Rating under the scheme is being carried out through empaneled rating agencies i.e. Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL), Credit Analysis & Research Limited (CARE), Onicra Credit Rating Agency of India Ltd. (ONICRA), Small and Medium Enterprises Rating Agency of India Ltd. (SMERA), ICRA limited and Brickwork India Ratings. Under this Scheme, rating fee payable by the micro and small enterprises is subsidized for the first year only and that is subject to maximum of 75% of the fee or Rs. 40000/-, whichever is less.</p>

            <p>The Ministry of MSME, Government of India and SIDBI set up the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) with a view to facilitate flow of credit to the MSE sector without the need for collaterals/ third party guarantees. The main objective of the scheme is that the lender should give importance to project viability and secure the credit facility purely on the primary security of the assets financed.</p>
            <p>The Credit Guarantee scheme (CGS) seeks to reassure the lender that, in the event of an MSE unit, which availed collateral- free credit facilities, fails to discharge its liabilities to the lender, the Guarantee Trust would make good the loss incurred by the lender up to 85 per cent of the outstanding amount in default.</p>
            <p>  The CGTMSE would provide cover for credit facility up to Rs. 100 lakh which have been extended by lending institutions without any collateral security and /or third party guarantees. A guarantee and annual service fee is charged by the CGTMSE to avail of the guarantee cover. Presently the guarantee fee and annual service charges are to be borne by the borrower.

The same are reviewed periodically for increase/ decrease in the limit sanctioned, and are expected to continue for a time frame much longer than 5 years.
