It is a camp-based approach, used for building awareness and enrolling suitable candidates. Such camps not only disseminate information about various skill training options available under the scheme, but also outline the possible career paths and income generation potential once the training is imparted.</p>
                            <p><strong>Rozgar Mela</strong>, the Scheme aligns itself to the Common Norms and, therefore, part of the TPs payment structure is linked to the placements. It is, therefore, important for the TP to place at least 50 percent of the batch under PMKVY to ensure that its performance is not downgraded. For this, TPs must conduct Rozgar Melas mandatorily every six months with adequate press and media coverage. The Rozgar Mela must have presence of at least four companies, which would extend employment offers to the candidates who have successfully completed their trainings under PMKVY.</p>

The programme is a part of the overall initiative for addressing economic issues in J&K. While steps are being taken by the State and Central Government to revive economic activity in J&K, Udaan programme is a special initiative to address the needs of the educated unemployed in J&K. Udaan program is focused on youth of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) who are graduate, post graduate and three year diploma engineers. The aim is to provide skills and job opportunities to the youth. Simultaneously, the aim is also to provide exposure to corporate India towards the rich talent pool available in J&K. </p>
                <p> The target was to reach out to 40,000 youth in J&K over a period of 5 years. It was observed that youth from J&K were unable to find employment in many companies as either they were unaware of the opportunity in the companies or the companies were unaware of the talent pool that existed in J&K. The principal focus of the Udaan programme is to create an ecosystem that would bridge this gap. The Udaan programme is designed to encourage corporates to travel to J&K meet with the youth and hire aspiring youth in J&K who wish to explore the opportunity to work with corporates. </p>
